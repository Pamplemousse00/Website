                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>My Printer is based off the ANET A8, which is originally based of the design of the Prusa i3. I have made modifications on the printer, which includes the following:
            <ul>
                <li>The direct drive extruder was replaced with a bowden system</li>
                <li>The heat bed was disconnected from the main power supply, now being connected to an old 250W computer PSU.</li>
                <li>A MOSFET was added to the heat bed circuit so that the main board does not need to bear the high current needed for the bed.</li>
                <li>The belts were replaced with higher quality fiber glass reinforced belts.</li>
                <li>General supports to improve frame rigidity.</li>
                <li>TODO - add bed levelling, print front frame support, make case to cover wiring and main board.</li>
            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <br>
                            After much trial and error, the printer was finally laying down plastic. Why not start off with something unnecesarily geometrically complex?

                            I had lots of problems with the bed warping when on high heat. This is a common problem with metal beds.

                        <p>Bowden updgrade!
                        <br>
                            Direct drive extruders commonly have a problem with wobble since the carriage is so heavy. To combat this issue, the stepper motor was removed from the extruder and placed on the frame of the printer.

                            This upgrade could lead to worse print results with flexible filaments, but I had no plans on using them anyways.
