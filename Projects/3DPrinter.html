            <h3>3D Printer</h3>
            My Printer is based off the ANET A8, which is originally based of the design of the Prusa i3. I have made modifications on the printer, which includes the following:
            <ul>
                <li>The direct drive extruder was replaced with a bowden system</li>
                <li>The heat bed was disconnected from the main power supply, now being connected to an old 250W computer PSU.</li>
                <li>A MOSFET was added to the heat bed circuit so that the main board does not need to bear the high current needed for the bed.</li>
                <li>The belts were replaced with higher quality fiber glass reinforced belts.</li>
                <li>General supports to improve frame rigidity.</li>
                <li>TODO - add bed levelling, print front frame support, make case to cover wiring and main board.</li>
            </ul>
            
            It was first bought in April 2016. The printer took about a week to build, set-up, and calibrate. This project taught me that hard work pays off, because boy was this project a challenge for me. I only had limited experience working with mechatronic appliances as I had previously been working with mostly electronic circuits.

                            After much trial and error, the printer was finally laying down plastic. Why not start off with something unnecesarily geometrically complex?
